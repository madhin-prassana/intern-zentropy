Uber’s Mission

We reimagine the way the world moves for the better

Weare Uber. The go-getters. The kind of people who are relentless about our mission to help people go anywhere
and get anything and earn their way. Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood. It runs through our veins. It’s
what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine how we can move better. For you.
For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the
entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.

Our Values

Our values reflect who we are and where we're going. They guide our decision-making, unite and define our

culture, and tell a story to the world about Uber’s corporate purpose.

Do the
right thing

Period.

Stand for safety

Safety never stops.

We embed — safety into
everything we do. Our relentless
pursuit to make Uber safer for
everyone using our platform
will continue to make us the
industry leader for safety. We
know the work of safety never
stops, yet we can and will
challenge ourselves to always
be better for the communities
we serve

Bring the mindset of a
champion.

Our ambition is what drives
us to achieve our mission.
How we define a champion
mindset isn’t based on how we
perform on our best days, it’s
how we respond on our worst
days. We hustle, embrace the
grind, overcome adversity, and
play to win for the people we
serve. Because it matters.

See the forest
andthe trees

Know the details that
matter.

Building for the intersection of
the physical and digital worlds
at global scale requires seeing
the big picture and the details.
Knowing the important details
can change the approach,
and small improvements can
compound into enormous
impact over time.

Trip obsessed

Make magic in the
marketplace.

The trip is where the marketplace
comes to life. The earner, rider,
eater, carrier, and merchant
are the people who connect
in our marketplace - and we
see every side. This requires
judgment to make difficult
trade-offs, blending algorithms
with human ingenuity, and the
ability to create simplicity from
complexity. When we get the
balance right for everyone, Uber
magic happens.

One Uber

Bet on something bigger.

It's powerful to be a part of
something bigger than any one
of us, or any one team. That’s why
we work together to do what's
best for Uber, not the individual
or team. We actively support our.
teammates, and they support
us - especially when we hit the.
inevitable bumps in the road.
We say what we mean, disagree
and commit, and celebrate our
progress, together.

Build with heart

We work at Uber because our
products profoundly affect lives
and we care deeply about our
impact. Putting ourselves in the
shoes of people who connect in
our marketplace helps us build
better products that positively
impact our communities and
partners. Our care drives us to
perfect our craft.

Great minds
don't think alike

iversity makes us
stronger.

We seek out diversity. Diversity
of ideas. Identity. Ethnicity.
Experience. Education. The more
diverse we become, the more
we can adapt and ultimately
achieve our mission. When we
reflect the incredible diversity
of the people who connect on
our platform, we make better
decisions that benefit the world.

PARTI
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber, ur,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology,
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary
technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We connect consumers
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other
consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)”
or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public
transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers
(‘Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,
transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to
everyday problems.

99 bye 29 6
e,

Our technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada,
Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).

Our Segments

As of December 31, 2022, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery
and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.

Mobility

Our Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing,
micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more—helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global
leadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and
data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.

We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a
variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We also participate in certain regions through our
minority-owned affiliates.

Delivery

Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery,
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We
launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and the business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and
Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform
overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing
their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization
and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-
qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-
a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.

Freight

We believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network
and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand
awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics
transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers’
shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch
of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics
solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with
real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and
Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management
and freight brokerage providers.

Platform Synergies
Our Platform

The foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.
Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.

Massive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers,
Merchants, Shippers and Carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.
Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of
December 31, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope
eventually billions, of people.

Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies
are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and
dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new
businesses and operationalize existing ones.

Operational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly
launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and
build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.

Product Expertise Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-
demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and
functionality, and deliver safety and trust.

We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing
offerings.

We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen
engagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the
value of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended
December 31, 2022, over 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended
December 31, 2022, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.9 Trips per month on average, compared to 4.6
Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We
believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.

With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our “Super
App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our
consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program
that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive
perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain
available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a
seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2022 with nearly 12 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass,
Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.

We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our
platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber’s advertising
division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process.
We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps,
and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and
analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with
consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2022, active advertising
merchants exceeded 315,000. We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so
as we onboard more advertisers.

Competitive Environment

We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery
industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost
alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize
these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to
become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range
of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing
them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of
our offerings includes:


## Page 10

**OCR Extracted Text:**

¢ Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of
passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-
hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility
offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other
ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,
Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

¢ Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various
regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, Gopuff, iFood,
Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services,
grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.

¢ Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality
Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.

Government Regulation

We operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state,
local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection,
intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation
network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted,
applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are
described below.

Mobility

Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and
regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and
local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to
our business model.

In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on
operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United
States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws,
tules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan,
South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning
certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment
creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.

Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted
Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or
mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their
destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle
inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.

In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For
example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5’), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker
is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los
Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under ABS, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary
damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a
preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,
the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved
Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent
work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain
their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of
Proposition 22. See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies” to
our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For
example:

« In London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews
at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with
respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and since September 2020,


## Page 11

**OCR Extracted Text:**

we have been operating under a license in London. Our current TfL license, a 30 month operating license, was granted to us
in May 2022.

+ Since April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaria de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations
implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and,
effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico
City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle
inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,
could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential
revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.

+ In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our
ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In
December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay
standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. As
another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on
our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider
regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while
providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in
countries outside the United States.

See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory
environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.

As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our
Mobility products.

Data Privacy and Protection

Our technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model
and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve
platform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection,
use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personal data, and these laws are increasing in number,
enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented
more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act
(the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection
requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, federal, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting
significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the
California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in
India.

Payments and Financial Services

Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our
subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of
certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine
that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such
jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect
our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and
approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.

Antitrust

Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of
governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as
the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.
In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations
we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit
or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our
pricing models.

Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in

which we operate. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names,

7

**OCR Extracted Text:**

software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights,
trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual
provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we
assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention
assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary
information in a commercially prudent manner.

Research and Development

Because the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete
successfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies.
We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through
research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.

Seasonality
Mobility

We typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results as we generate higher Gross Bookings in our fourth
quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower Gross
Bookings in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North
America and Europe. We have typically experienced quarter-over-quarter declines in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2022, we
experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19
variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic
patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.

Delivery

We typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results with increases in our Gross Bookings in the first and
fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal
fluctuations. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These
primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that
seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.

Human Capital at Uber
Employees

We are a global company and as of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 32,800 employees globally
and operations in approximately 70 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are
developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and
the Board of Directors.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other
personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our
competitors.

Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and the Compensation Committee has incorporated
employee retention metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives.

Adapting to a New Way of Working. In 2022, more than two years after we asked employees who were able to do so work
remotely in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reopened our offices and welcomed our employees back to the office. The world of
work has changed significantly in the last two years, and in response we have evolved our work philosophy to reflect all that we have
learned and what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and our business going forward. Our work model has
shifted to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home.

Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can
find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the
culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey
that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by
collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of these regular checks to
better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and
recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback. In
addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations


## Page 13

**OCR Extracted Text:**

through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic
diversity.

Employee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged,
satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch
assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs.
Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to
have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and
resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life’s expected and unexpected
events. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as
well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.

and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I,
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our 2022 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The
information in the 2022 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe that great minds don’t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and
valued. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when
employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To
achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress. For
example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals,
people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for
leadership roles come from historically underrepresented groups.

Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance
metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives.

We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager,
Uber’s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.

As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically,
economically, or socially. To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and
create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company. In July 2020, we announced commitments to becoming a more anti-
racist company and since then, we have made progress on our commitment to build racial equity internally and externally. For
example, with the goal of ridding racism from our platform, we rolled out anti-racism and unconscious bias training for riders and
drivers in the United States and Brazil.

ESG Report, which are available on our website. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.

Driver and Courier Well-Being

In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers,
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.

In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world,
providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created
through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed
schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and
is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and
global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.

Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market
and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more
can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across
countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees
receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an
employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to
be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.
Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.

+ Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the


## Page 14

**OCR Extracted Text:**

social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their
users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some recent examples of our advocacy to preserve
flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:

e In Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits
such as minimum earnings guarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.

e In Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government’s healthcare and
pensions scheme and introduces new requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for
time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance coverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.

+ Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for
independent workers.

+ Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them
save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential
is highest).

+ Learning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible
Drivers and their family members through undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills
development and language learning. For example, since its launch in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has
enrolled nearly 5,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.

+ Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our
platform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around
the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the
world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our
support services, and other matters.

For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers,
merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to
platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-

currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.

Risk Factor Summary

10


## Page 15

**OCR Extracted Text:**

The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating
results, or prospects.

Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of
independent contractors.

The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that
have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every
major geographic region.

To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and
we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.

We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our
operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.

If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a
result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.

Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or
unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media
coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to
rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to
suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and
our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.

If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and
future prospects will be adversely affected.

Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major
safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.
These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.

We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may
be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other
circumstances.

We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before
our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or
may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.

We have experienced and may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use
of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.

Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, and phishing attacks
could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks,
our business may be adversely impacted.

We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and
circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for
implementing these commitments.

Outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of actions to mitigate such pandemic, have
adversely affected, and future outbreaks of disease may adversely affect, parts of our business.

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in
certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with
our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable
terms or at all.

Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business
Operational Risks
Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United
States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action
lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social
security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those
statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other
things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’
platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the
classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending
and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be
material to our business.

In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or
expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the
classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid
approximately $521 million as of December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the
enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively
impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our
business and financial condition.

Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions
regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees
where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became
effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5
requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for
drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that
Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be
required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s
preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods
before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may
continue to be filed.

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the
Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an
injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat
Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial
decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers,

12


## Page 17

**OCR Extracted Text:**

including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest
period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case,
we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to
Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected. Additionally, we may not have
adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may
not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to
fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery
service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French
Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions
regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for
Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status
and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective
bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead
to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally
recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms
were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and
reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial
statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical
accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-
K and Note | in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been
available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic
region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely
impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets
in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally
and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the
future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In
addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-
cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and
other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods
and provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and
most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our
competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized
expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and
offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may
adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers value more
highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased
competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of
platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.

We face competition in each of our offerings, including:

* Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of
passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-
hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our
Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with
other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft,
Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

+ Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in

13


## Page 18

**OCR Extracted Text:**

various regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi,
iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including
those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional
grocers.

+ Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation
providers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote,
Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.

Many of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and
promotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those
that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and
access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our competitors
in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories,
larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be
able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer
preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may
share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to
incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.

As a result of certain divestitures, we are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect
to certain aspects of our business, including in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia
through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned
affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain countries in Latin
America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and
Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in
additional geographic markets. In addition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates
with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.

Additionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such
acquisitions or may consummate them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory
approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or part of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies.
Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.

For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to
compete effectively would have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.

To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we
have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which
has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance.

To remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue
to lower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts
and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the
total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times
meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we do
not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and
consumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such
Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and
reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance.
Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will
likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing
models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the
information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the
application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely
impacted.

The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate
that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders have made substantial
investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into
strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive
advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices,
offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and

Carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or
maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which
we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to
achieve profitability.

We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our
operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.

We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion. We
will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve
profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or
increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as
we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform
through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development
expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform.
These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset
these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or
contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products
that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a
lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to
grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after
considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in
these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain
profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies
we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur
significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience
operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.

If we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a
result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be
adversely impacted.

Our success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in that
geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer
their services through our platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We
have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate. To
the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the
Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if Carriers
choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers
in specific geographic markets to attract Shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery
services in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing
websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack
access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A
significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and
this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments
experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics
services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, Carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal,
which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity
and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than some
competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining
a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more
important to service quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors’ products
achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network
effect.

Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things,
dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives),
dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support,
dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents
and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar
public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed,

dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In
addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents,
in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers,
merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign
encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract
and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business
would suffer.

The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including
Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and
offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing
models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we
aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work,
we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce
Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.

Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users
views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud,
help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings
or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with
platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which
may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in
protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and
any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our
number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.
Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our
network and would harm our future operating results.

In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to
onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there
have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check
process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our
qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide
rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to
undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access
information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required
changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates
or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new
Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check
provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in
our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue
using our platform.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage,
including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our
brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to
preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny,
litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and
fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our
brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and
offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As
a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions
and market shares, and may continue to do so.

We recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other
critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any
future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include
disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party

assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory
scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity
could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly
interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation
could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies,
including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel
with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in
connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS,
and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these
businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled
by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities
to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers
provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise
violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these
third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will
depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and
workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing
our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant
costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will
make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully
maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public
perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a
failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in
the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize
compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values
and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may
continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked
coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we
have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful.

Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several
reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future
reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.

Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the
complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations,
systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to
manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.

As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,800 global
employees as of December 31, 2022, of whom approximately 19,200 were located outside the United States. We expect the total
number of our employees located outside the United States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will
require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial
and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if
we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our
existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have
implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on
our business, and may in the future implement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield
unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or
reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire
new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce.
Properly managing our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and
functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business.
